## Description

This application, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is a timed multiple choice quiz designed to test the user's knowledge of basic JavaScript. In its current form, the user has 75 seconds to answer quiz's 5 questions. The game starts when the user clicks the "start" button, at which point the timer starts counting down the time remaining for the user to answer all questions. The current question and its answers are displayed on the screen and the user can select an answer by clicking on it. If the user selects the correct answer, they proceed to the next question. If the user selects an incorrect answer, they still proceed to the next question but 10 seconds are deducted from the remaining time. When the user has answered all the questions or the timer reaches zero, the game ends and the final score is displayed. The user's score is calculated based upon their remaining time upon completion of all 5 questions. When the game is done, the user is also asked to enter their initials and submit their score so that their score may be compared with other users on the same device using the device's local storage.
