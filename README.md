# Programmers Proving Ground

## Description

This application, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is a timed multiple choice quiz designed to test the user's knowledge of basic JavaScript. Specifically, this application has been built to be used to help aspiring developers study for coding interviews. In its current iteration, the user has 75 seconds to answer quiz's 5 questions, although more questions may eventually be added. The game starts when the user clicks the "start" button, at which point the timer begins counting down the time remaining for the user to answer all questions. The current question and its answers are displayed on the screen and the user can select an answer by clicking on it. If the user selects the correct answer they proceed to the next question. If the user selects an incorrect answer they still proceed to the next question, however, 10 seconds are deducted from their remaining time. When the user has answered all the questions or the timer reaches zero, the game ends and the final score is displayed. The user's score is calculated based upon their remaining time upon completion of all 5 questions. When the game is done, the user is asked to enter their initials and submit their final score so that their score may be compared with other users on the same device using the information saved to local storage.

## Installation

No installation is required to use this application. Those who wish to use it may simply follow the deployment link available in this readme or on the link available in the git repo. Alternatively, users may clone the repo and open the index.html file in the browser using the files cloned to their local system.

## Usage

To use this application, click on the 'start quiz' button to begin the quiz. This will reveal the question and four answer buttons below it. Users can click on the response that they think is correct and will be taken to the next question. This process repeats until all questions have been answered or time expires. When users are done, they will be prompted to input their initials into a form and click a submit button to save their initials and score for posterity. Users can then refresh the page if they wish to attempt the quiz again for a better score. 

Those who would like to tailor their quiz experience may clone the GitHub repo to their local site so that they may access the source code. Accessing the source code makes it easy for users to modify the number and content of the questions, the total time allowed to answer all questions, and even the time penalty for incorrect answers, thereby letting users tailor the quiz based upon their level of experience and knowledge surrounding JavaScript. In this regard, this application can be an excellent tool to study concepts in JavaScript.

Please note that user scores will not be updated to be reflected on the scoreboard until after the page has been reloaded, following submission.
